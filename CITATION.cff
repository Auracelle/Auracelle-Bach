  Auracelle Bach is a comprehensive AI governance intelligence suite
  integrating behavioral science, cognitive architecture, and mathematical
  intelligence for policy optimization and institutional analysis. The system
  combines Bayesian uncertainty quantification, multi-objective optimization,
  network analysis, and live API integration with moral foundations theory
  and trust dynamics for evidence-based governance research.
